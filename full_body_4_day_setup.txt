getting the upper/lower split:

- create a list for every exercise (horizontal push, pull, vertical push, pull, quad, ham, compounds) 
- create a for loop to get each exercise
- append to the new in each loop
- repeat this process for each training day of the week (if 6 days, 3 upper and 3 lower, means there should a 3 loops for upper and 3 loops for lower)
